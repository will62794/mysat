\begin{frame}{Overview and Project Goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Satisfiability is the canonical NP-complete problem.
    
    \item Much work has been devoted to building efficient SAT solvers over last decades.\\
    
    \item \textbf{Project Goal:} Implement a basic SAT solver based on CDCL (conflict driven clause learning), which is the dominant core technique used by most modern SAT solvers.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Gain a deeper understanding of the DPLL and CDCL based algorithms for SAT solving
        \item Compare a naive implementation with state of the art solver performance
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{DPLL}
    Basic idea of DPLL algorithm is to do a depth first, brute force search with backtracking and some basic optimizations included.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Unit Propagation}
    Core resolution rule employed in DPLL, and also in CDCL as we will see later.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Conflict Driven Clause Learning}
    Idea: when you encounter a conflict in the search tree, \textit{learn} a clause that prevents you from making the same mistake again.
